<p class="dropcap vspace"><span class="smcap1">SON</span> of Jacob Bright, of Greenbank, Rochdale, Lancashire; born in 1811;
one of the firm of John Bright and Brothers, cotton spinners and
manufacturers, Rochdale; a member of the Society of Friends; joined the
Anti-Corn-Law League soon after its formation in 1838, and, with Mr. Cobden,
became one of its leading members, and the powerful champion of Free Trade;
returned to Parliament for the city of Durham in 1843, and continued to sit
as its representative till 1847, when he was elected for Manchester; opposed
the war with Russia, 1854; rejected at Manchester at the General
Election in 1857, consequent on the defeat of Lord Palmerston’s Government
on the China question; returned for Birmingham the same year,
and is still member for that constituency; the great advocate of Free
Trade, Financial Reform, a wide extension of the Suffrage, a redistribution
of Seats and the Ballot, of the cause of Ireland and India, of
National Education, and of Peace; in the American Civil War took the
Anti-Slavery side, and was the staunch supporter of the Northern States;
visited Ireland in 1866; accepted a post in Mr. Gladstone’s Cabinet in 1868<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
as President of the Board of Trade&mdash;the state of his health prevented him from
undertaking the duties of the India Office&mdash;when he was nominated a Privy
Councillor; resigned office at the end of 1870; on his health becoming more
satisfactory, he returned to the Gladstone Cabinet in 1873, as Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, but retired with his colleagues at the beginning of
the following year.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright is one of the most eloquent and effective orators of his time,
and his speeches were collected and published in 1868; the policy which he
has for so many years advocated has in most points been in the end accepted
by the nation.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
